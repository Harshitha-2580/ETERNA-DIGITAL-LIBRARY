                    written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around Norman Storm, a 
                    man embroiled in financial turmoil and personal conflicts, particularly 
                    regarding his marriage to Leila. As Norman grapples with his deteriorating

                    are further compounded when he unexpectedly spots Leila in the city, although 
                    she had not informed him of her plans. As the story unfolds, Norman faces the 
                    unsettling truth of Leila's possible deceit, igniting his jealousy and suspicions 
                    about her fidelity.

                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"The Lonely House" by Marie Belloc Lowndes is a novel written in 
                    the early 20th century. The story introduces us to Lily Fairfield, an English girl 
                    who leaves her sheltered life after the death of her aunt to stay with distant 
                    relatives, the Count and Countess Polda, at their villa in Monaco. As she seeks a 
                    fresh start on the French Riviera, the novel hints at deeper themes of loneliness, 
                    vulnerability, and potentially sinister experiences that await her in her new home. 
                    At the start of the story, Lily embarks on her journey to La Solitude, her new 
                    residence, filled with hope yet subconsciously burdened by past traumas. The opening 
                    chapters recount her vivid dreams and her arrival in the picturesque yet isolating 
                    setting of the Polda's villa. Upon meeting her relatives, Lily's initial enthusiasm 
                    is shadowed by an eerie atmosphere, strange occurrences, and unsettling interactions 
                    with the household staff and her distant relatives.  </p>

                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"Benighted" by J. B. Priestley is a novel written in the late 
                    1920s. The story begins with a tense and unsettling journey as the main characters, 
                    Philip, Margaret, and Penderel, navigate treacherous mountain roads during a storm. 
                    The narrative captures their struggles with both the harsh external environment and 
                    their internal conflicts, hinting at deeper themes of fear, isolation, and 
                    interpersonal dynamics. At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Philip 
                    Waverton, who feels insecure while driving through the chaotic Welsh mountains 
                    amidst heavy rain and ominous weather. His wife, Margaret, expresses frustration 
                    about their predicament, suggesting they should have turned back. Penderel, their 
                    companion, injects humor and levity into the situation, but the looming threat of 
                    landslides and floods creates an atmosphere of anxiety. The trio's journey takes a 
                    dramatic turn when they find themselves trapped and eventually seek shelter in a 
                    mysterious and seemingly desolate house inhabited by the strange Femm family. </p>

                    early 20th century. The story is mainly narrated by Nick Carraway, who reflects on the
                     life of his enigmatic neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and the extravagant world of wealth and 
                     excess he inhabits. The novel explores themes of the American Dream, love, and social

                       toward a distant green light, symbolizing his unattainable dreams.</p>

                     20th century. The story revolves around four women who seek a transformative escape 
                     from their mundane lives in cold, rainy England to the alluring sunshine of a

                     advertisement, an unexpected bond forms, leading them to consider sharing the castle 
                     with two other women to make the plan financially feasible.  </p>
