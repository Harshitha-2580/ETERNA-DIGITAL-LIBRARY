                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"The Jungle Book" by Rudyard Kipling is a collection of stories originally published in the late 19th century. It primarily revolves around the adventures of a young boy named Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle, exploring themes of nature, survival, and the clash between civilization and the wild. The narrative delves into the bonds formed between Mowgli and various animal characters, highlighting the laws that govern the lives of jungle inhabitants. At the start of the book, the story introduces Mowgli's origins as he is discovered by Father Wolf after wandering into the wolf pack's territory. The fierce tiger Shere Khan poses a threat as he seeks to claim Mowgli for himself. Mother Wolf, however, fiercely defends Mowgli, declaring him as her own and igniting a debate among the pack members about the consequences of accepting a human child into their midst. This opening sets the stage for Mowgli’s complex relationship with both the jungle and the human world, showcasing the challenges he faces as he grows up estranged from both realms. </p>

                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"White Fang" by Jack London is a novel written during the late 19th century. This compelling narrative explores the life of a wild wolf/dog hybrid named White Fang, set against the harsh backdrop of the North American wilderness. The story delves into themes of survival, nature versus nurture, and the complexity of relationships between humans and animals. The opening chapters introduce readers to the bleak and unforgiving landscape of the Arctic, where the protagonist, amidst his struggles for survival, embodies the fierce spirit of the Wild. The beginning of "White Fang" paints a vivid picture of the stark, desolate environment, focusing on two men traveling through the frozen wilderness, transporting a dead body on a sled. As they engage in dialogue about their grim circumstances and the haunting presence of wolves nearby, a sense of foreboding envelops the narrative. Tension builds as the men become increasingly aware of their precarious position, closely pursued by hungry wolves. </p>
