                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens is a historical novel 
                    written in the mid-19th century. Set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, 
                    the story opens with an exploration of the social and political turmoil of the time, 
                    introducing key themes such as resurrection, sacrifice, and the dichotomy between 
                    oppression and liberty. The narrative begins with the character Mr. Jarvis Lorry's 
                    journey, who is on a mission to retrieve Dr. Alexandre Manette, an imprisoned former 
                    physician, who has been "recalled to life" after years of suffering. The opening of 
                    the novel vividly depicts the contrasting conditions in England and France, 
                    emphasizing the hardships faced by common people. A detailed scene unfolds as 
                    Mr. Lorry, traveling on a Dover mail coach, encounters a mysterious messenger who 
                    brings him a message related to Dr. Manette. As Mr. Lorry arrives in Paris, we sense 
                    ominous undertones of the Revolution as Madame Defarge's wine shop symbolizes the 
                    brewing discontent. The narrative hints at the challenges ahead as characters 
                    intertwine in a story of personal and political upheaval, setting the stage for 
                    the unfolding drama that explores the quest for justice in the face of tyranny. </p>

                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">"The Spy" by James Fenimore Cooper is a historical novel written in the early 
                    19th century. The book delves into the complexities of political allegiance during the

                      landscape of divided loyalties in Westchester County, New York. The opening of 
                      "The Spy" introduces us to the precarious environment of Westchester County during 
                      the year 1780, where a traveler seeks shelter from an impending storm. This traveler,

                       conversations. The story begins to unfold with the sense that Birch is more than 
                       he seems, hinting at his secret role in the war and setting the stage for a tale 
                       of espionage and the moral challenges faced in times of conflict. </p>

                <p style="font-size:18px;">"At the Mountains of Madness" by H. P. Lovecraft 
                    is a novella blending science fiction and horror, written in the early 
                    20th century. The narrative revolves around an Antarctic expedition led 
                    by a geologist from Miskatonic University that uncovers ancient and 
                    prohibited truths about Earth's primordial past. The protagonist warns 
                    of the potential catastrophic consequences of uncovering these secrets, 
                    particularly linked to a mysterious earlier civilization that may lie
